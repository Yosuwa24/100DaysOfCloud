# Cloudformation Demo


## Cloud Research

When you create stack on cloudformation, make sure you have already made the template using Java or Yaml format or you can use template provided by AWS. The stack will create the resources in accordance to your template. If you delete the stack later on, it will delete the resources within. 

## Try yourself

 1. Enter into Cloudformation service on your console.
 2. Create stack
 3. Since I have already got the template, so here what I chose in this step

 4. When you click view in designer, it shows us how our stack look like. Here is mine

5. Here is the next step, and dont forget to make a keypair first on the EC2 instance. The **LatestAmiId** will refer to the template you have filled.

6. On the configure stack options, I dont fill anything and just click next.
7. Tick and create stack
