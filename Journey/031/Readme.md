# Creating ALB & ASG and Practicing Exam

## Cloud Research

**Creating ALB & ASG**

It is a cloud quest challenge. I have been given a condition to have three instance at minimum and it should apply application load balancer.

When setting up, it takes focus on implementing the security group of the instance so that it can be connected with the application load balancer.


**Practicing exam**

I have been given free access on exam practice since I have already completed 12 missions on AWS cloud quest. Thankfully, I passed on the practice but still need to learn the gap knowledge.
