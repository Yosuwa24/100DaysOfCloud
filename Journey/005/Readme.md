## Cloud Research

- Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)

transport layer provides service to application layer
it also provides error mechanism which enable client send request again if an error happens when transferring data

- Network Layer

IP

IP is commonly used. The function is to give name to each computer in order it can communicate each other.

Routing

it can be illustrated as a postal service. It is assigned to send the data to a certain address. It will decide the fastest route to the address.

- Physical Layer

It defines how to connect computer to computer using cabling and energy in the network
cabling can be wired or wireless

- Data Link Layer

Data link layer defines protocol in the physical network. It has error detection mechanism called FCS (Frame Check sequence). If data link detects an error in the network, it will report to transport layer to fix the error

- Encapsulation

The process of sending data

Data -> Application Layer

TCP Data -> Transport Layer

IP TCP Data -> Network Layer

Data link IP TCP DATA Data link -> Data link layer

10100 -> Physical layer

- Decapsulation

The process of receiving data. It has  process of encapsulation in reverse.

- Name of TCP/IP Messages

Data 

TCP Data -> Segment 

IP TCP Data -> IP Packet 

Data link IP TCP DATA Data link -> Frame

101011 -> Binnary

- Network Fundamental Exam

Thank God! I passed the exam. Now I have my first certificate on Network Fundamental.
