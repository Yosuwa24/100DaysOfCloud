**Creating Clone**

If you would like to have more than one vm with the same specification like the previous vm, you do not need to install it again on the virtualbox. Instead, you can just clone it. The steps are very simple. 

1. Right click on the vm you want to clone. Then click clone

2. Fill in the name, select the path and the mac policy. Here I leave it as default and click next

3. Choose the clone type, and clone.
4. When you start the cloned VM, the username and password will be the same as the previous VM.

**Creating Snapshot**

The snapshot function here is to save the work you have done on your vm. If you would like to make a configuration but you worry it will fail, I suggest that you have to make a snapshot first before you do the configuration. It can recall the setting the you have done. The steps are very simple.

1. After you make some configuration inside the vm, close the vm by selecting power off.
2. Then, click this button, you will find clone and click it.

3. Click on take and fill in the name of snapshot and detail (if necessary).

4. Try to open the vm, make some configuration like touch a.txt, then power it off. It will be back again as you have never done the touch configuration.

**Export & Import VM**

These features enable you to transfer the vm to another pc, if the pc also uses virtualbox software for vm. So, you can click on export and later if you want to import the file, just click on it and open using vm manager. Later it will open, and the username and password will be the same like the previous vm.

**Resetting VM Mac Address**

Before you connect the vm to the internet or to other pc, please make sure the VMs you create have different mac address. The steps are simple. 
- Click on settings of the vm
- Click on network
- Click on advance
- Click the refresh button on the mac address field, and you will have a new mac address
