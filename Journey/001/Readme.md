## Introduction

First thing first, we should know what IP address is since it will be needed to learn cloud. The network fundamental is needed if you have no background in networking. 

## Cloud Research
These are the materials that I learnt on day 1. I took Aguna course and AWS CCP:

Aguna Course
- Introduction to Computer Network
  Computer network means devices can interact each other through several process. It needs to connect to router, then router connects to ISP and ISP will find information on the     internet. If several devices connect to the same router it means it can share data to each other. For instance, multiple laptops can print at the same time using the same         printer.
