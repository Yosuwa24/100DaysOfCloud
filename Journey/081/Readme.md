**Definition**

A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a containerâ€™s network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.

A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear.

## Installing Docker Engine on EC2 Instance Demo

1. **Create EC2 Instance using amazon linux AMI and t2.micro (Free tier) with public ip address**
2. **Installing docker on EC2**

- Run this command to install the engine

      sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker

- Start the docker engine

      sudo service docker start
      
- Enable your EC2 interact with the docker machine

      sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

- Logout and login

       sudo su - ec2-user

3. **Build docker image**

- Run this command to create directory

      cd container
    
- create the container first. 

      docker build -t containerofcats .
    
- Create the image

      docker images --filter reference=containerofcats
    
4. **Run container from image**

       docker run -t -i -p 80:80 containerofcats
