# AWS CCP (Course on Udemmy by Stephane Mareek) : EC2


## Prerequisite
Though you want to have ccp certificate in the end, I think you have to know first what VM is, since EC2 is a virtual machine. I have already taken some topics on Aguna course : Virtual Machine Fundamental. It discussed what virtual machine is, how it works and so on. 


## Cloud Research

**Creating Budget**

Before creating an instance using EC2, you have to create budget using IAM user. From the root user you have to activate the access for IAM user. By doing so, the IAM user can create budget.

**Overview of EC2**
- It is IAAS
- Renting virtual machine
- Storing data
- Scalling the service
- OS : Linux, windows, Mac OS
- Can set how much the cpu power, RAM, storage
- Can set network card
- Can set firewall rules
- Bootstrap script using EC2 user data

**Creating Instance**

It has several steps :

1. Choose your region
2. After clicking launch instance, Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 
3. Choose type of instance
4. Configure instance and add script of user data
5. Add storage
6. Add tags
7. Configure security gruop
8. Launch the instance

It takes about 10 seconds to run and you can stop it later.

Once you start again, then it will have different public ip.
