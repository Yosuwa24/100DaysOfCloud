## Yosuwa's Cloud Journey

New learner on cloud. I was an English teacher, call center agent, trainer and now ready to know some basic things about cloud 

Technology grows rapidly and cloud is used widely. To adapt in this era everyone needs to learn basic IT things including cloud. I would like to prove that everyone can learn cloud!

In the end, I would like to have basic knowledge of networking (IP address), virtual machine and cloud. Really hope can do some presentation using some VM. Really hope that I can be a Certified Cloud Practicioner (thank God I passed the exam on day 45). Since day 46, I encourage my self to learn deeper so that one day I can pass the AWS Solution Architect Associate!
