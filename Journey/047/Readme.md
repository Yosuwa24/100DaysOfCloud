- What human sees : 
  133.33.33.7
- What the robot sees:
  10000101.00100001.00100001.00000111

So, there is a conversion rule here. This one are the rules:

133.33.33.7
- Each decimal number between dots has a value between 0-255
- The first we will convert 133
- Based on this table 133 becomes 10000101

Move through the binary table, left to right
1. Compare decimal number to Binary position value, if smaller write 0 then move to the next table
2. If it is equal or larger - minus the binary position value from your decimal number, add 1 in the binary value column
3. Move on the next position, go to #1 (with the new decimal value)
