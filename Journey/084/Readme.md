## Cloud Research

### Amazon ECR (Elastic container registry)
- Fully integrated with ECS, backed by amazon s3
- Access is controlled through IAM (permission errors > policy)
- Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, image tags, image lifecycle

### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- It is a way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
- EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or Fargate to deploy serverless containers
- Use case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
