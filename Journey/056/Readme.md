## Cloud Research

**DNS - Domain Name System**

Definition
It allows us to search a website based on name, translating a domain into IP address. When we type on our browser www.amazon.com it actually has some work frame. First, it will ask to the dns resolver (you may call it a phone book) to bridge the communication gap. It will search for the right IP for a specific domain. 

**DNS Lookup**
we type abc.com in our web browser - DNS Resolver - Root server - Top level domain server (.com) - Auth name server / domain name server - IP address - DNS Resolver - web browser - particular web server (abc.com) 

**Root server**
There are twelve different organization that organize the root server. 


**Registering domain using Route 53**

It is actually a simple step. You can just look up route 53 on AWS service. Then register domain and type the name of the domain. Later it will inform you the availability and also the price.
