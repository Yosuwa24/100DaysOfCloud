**Cloudformation**

- To make it easy to create environment especially if you have more than one environment, AWS provide us cloudformation. It is categorized as a platform as service. 

- It is free and we only pay for the resources used.

- Cloudformation can use one of these formats for the template:

yaml or json

- After creating the template, cloudformation will create a stack, a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. Cloudformation can create more than one stack from a template.

- Cloudformation can create, update, delete stack.
