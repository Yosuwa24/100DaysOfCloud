### Virtualization 101

Virtualization is terms for unning more than one OS in one hardware. It needs hypevisor so that the OS can think that it is hardware. While Kernel is part of the OS that can access directly to the hardware. There four methods of performing virtualization:

- [Emulated Virtualization](https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/emulation-or-virtualization-what-s-the-difference/)
- [Paravirtualization](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/paravirtualization#:~:text=Paravirtualization%20is%20an%20enhancement%20of,emulate%20an%20entire%20hardware%20environment.)
- [Hardware Assisted Virtualization](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/hardware-assisted-virtualization#:~:text=Hardware%2Dassisted%20virtualization%20is%20the,system%20designs%20of%20the%201960s)
