## Cloud Research

- Moving data from a source to a destination
- It discuss IP address, subnet mask, Route and Route Tables, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

**IP Address**
- IP address has 2 versions namely v4 and v6
- For the v4, it contains network and host parts. for example, 133.33.3.7 has network part which is 133.33 and host part which is 3.7

**Subnet Mask**
- configured on a host device in addition to an IP address e.g. 255.255.0.0

**ARP (Adress Resolution Protocol)**
