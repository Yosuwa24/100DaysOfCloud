# Cloud Quest : Creating ASG and Creating EFS


## Cloud Research

**Creating Auto Scalling Group**

The task is based on the challeng on the game in which the game server needs to have 0 instance at 1 AM everyday. So, basically after creating 2 instances and the auto scalling group, it just needs to set the schedule on auto scaling group setting.

**Creating EFS**

Elastic File System on AWS enbles us to mount the storage to one or more instances. It is not like EBS that can only be attached to one instance. So, the game challenge us to attach the EFS to three instance with different availability zones.
